# Brainstorm Repository

A structured repository for brainstorming sessions, problem analysis, and solution development with AI assistance.

## 📁 Repository Structure


brainstorm/
├── requirements/           # Problem statements and initial requirements
├── outcomes/              # Solution guides and final outputs organized by topic
├── MEMORY_INDEX.md        # Quick reference for all discussions and artifacts
└── README.md             # This file


## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Requirements Input
Place your problem statements, questions, or requirements in the /requirements/ directory using this format:

{background of project/feature/problem you are trying to solve}
{your initial thoughts and approach}
{specific questions that seek input from AI}


### 2. Solution Development
AI analyzes requirements and creates comprehensive solutions in /outcomes/ organized by topic with:
- Detailed analysis and multiple solution options
- Pros and cons for each approach
- Implementation recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 3. Memory Tracking
All discussions and artifacts are indexed in MEMORY_INDEX.md for quick context retrieval in future sessions.

## 🎯 Current Topics

### Caching Strategy Solutions
- *Problem:* Microservice platform with 50 APIs experiencing performance issues
- *Solution:* Multi-level caching strategy with Redis cluster and phased implementation
- *Location:* outcomes/caching-strategy/

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. *Start with requirements:* Create clear problem statements in /requirements/
2. *Reference memory:* Check MEMORY_INDEX.md for existing discussions
3. *Organized outcomes:* Solutions are automatically organized by topic in /outcomes/
4. *Future context:* The memory index helps AI quickly understand past discussions

## 🔄 Maintenance

The repository automatically maintains:
- Topic-based organization
- Memory index updates
- Structured solution documentation
- Cross-reference capabilities
